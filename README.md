# BookIt-Chatbot
The current pandemic has tragically impacted businesses, including my mom’s nails business. Since English is her second language, I have noticed sometimes my mom miscommunicates with her customers either in person or while taking appointments over the phone. That’s why I’m going to dedicate this project to building a chatbot that can take appointment bookings via phone.  I name this chatbot BookIt.  BookIt focuses on cosmetics domain, specifically manicures and pedicures.
