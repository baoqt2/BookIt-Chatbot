# BookIt-Chatbot
The current pandemic has tragically impacted businesses, including my mom’s nails business. Since English is her second language, I have noticed sometimes my mom miscommunicates with her customers either in person or while taking appointments over the phone. That’s why I’m going to dedicate this project to building a chatbot that can take appointment bookings via phone.  I name this chatbot BookIt.  BookIt focuses on cosmetics domain, specifically manicures and pedicures.

In order to succeed taking a cosmetics appointment from a customer, BookIt is capable of responding to requests about what services the shop has to offer as well as telling prices, staff availability, operation hours and location.  After successfully scheduling an appointment for a customer, BookIt saves the calling customer’s information for later reference since customers usually prefer their regular manicurists. 

BookIt can also send out a reminder 30 minutes prior a booked appointment. In the text reminder, the customer has an option to cancel the appointment by texting ‘cancel’ or ‘c’.
